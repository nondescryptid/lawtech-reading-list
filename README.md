## About 
Hi! The world is moving terribly fast, and we wake up every day a little more ignorant than we were the day before. One of the hardest things is not knowing where to start -- Hopefully, this list will help people who are interested in learning more about law and technology, but don't really know where to begin.  

## Tech of Law
How do technology and law intersect? 

### Legal informatics 
The management of information is crucial to the proper functioning of any legal system. A good legal system relies on information about the world itself (such as evidence of who did what and when) as well as more purely legal information (such as court rulings, statutes, contracts, and so forth). Legal Informatics is the theory and practice of managing such information. It covers both legal theory and information theory. ([Source](https://law.stanford.edu/courses/legal-informatics/))

#### Computational Law
Computational law is a branch of legal informatics concerned with the mechanization of legal reasoning (whether done by humans or by computers) ([Source](http://complaw.stanford.edu/readings/complaw.html))
